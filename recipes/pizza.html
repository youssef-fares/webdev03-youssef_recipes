      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>
          Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl.
          <br />Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots
          remain.
          <br />Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after
          each addition. <br />When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a
          lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to
          coat with oil.
          <br />Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95
          degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) <br />
          until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4
          equal pieces, and form each into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in
          diameter.
          <br />Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of
          tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the
          dough. <br />
          Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then
          place 5 basil leaves on top. <br />Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon
          olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. <br />Repeat for 3
          remaining dough balls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven.
          <br />Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is
          golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
