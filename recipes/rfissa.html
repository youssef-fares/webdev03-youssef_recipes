      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <h3>Ahead of time</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Making and shredding msemen is best done ahead of time. Tear the
          msemen into bite-size pieces while hot off the griddle.
          <br />When cool, store in a plastic bag. If prepared more than a day
          in advance, freeze the shredded msemen until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The night before (or at least six hours before cooking), soak the
          fenugreek seeds and lentils in separate bowls of cold water.
          <br />(If you forget to do this, you can do a quick soak by pouring
          boiling water over the fenugreek and lentils and letting them sit an
          hour or two.) <br />Drain when ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The night before (or at least six hours before cooking), mix the
          chicken with the onions, olive oil, salt, pepper, ginger, turmeric,
          saffron and Ras el Hanout spices in a heavy-bottomed pot.
          <br />Stir to coat the chicken well, cover, and leave in the fridge to
          marinate.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cook the Chicken and Lentils</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the pot with the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook,
          covered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 20 minutes, until a
          rich sauce has formed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the drained fenugreek seeds, parsley, cilantro and the water.
          Cover and simmer over medium-low to medium heat for about 1 hour.
          <br />
          Add the drained lentils and continue cooking, covered, for another
          hour, or until the chicken and lentils are quite tender. <br />
          Add water as needed during cooking to ensure that ample broth remains
          in the pot, and correct seasoning if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taste the broth for salt, then add the smen, swirling the pot to
          incorporate it into the broth.
          <br />If desired, remove the chicken from the pot and place it under a
          broiler for a few minutes to brown and crisp the skin.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Serve the Chicken Rfissa</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Steam the shredded msemen in a couscoussier for about 10 minutes, or
          until steaming hot and tender. Spread or mound the hot, shredded
          msemen on a large serving dish.
          <br />Add the chicken to the bed of msemen, and distribute the
          lentils, onions and most of the broth over all. <br />Reserve a
          bowlful or two of broth to offer on the side. (If you tied the
          fenugreek in cheesecloth, empty it into a bowl to offer on the side as
          well.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Rfissa is traditionally enjoyed communally from the serving dish, with
          each person eating from his own side of the plate by hand or with a
          spoon.
